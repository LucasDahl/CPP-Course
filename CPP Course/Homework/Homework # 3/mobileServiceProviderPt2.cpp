/*
 Modify the program in Problem 5 so that it also displays how much package A customers would save if they purchased package B or C, and how much money Package B customers would save if they purchases Package C. If there would be no savings, no message should be printed.

 Note:

 It is easier to first calculate the cost of all plans (A, B, and C) based on the number of minutes the user-entered. Then based on the plan user chose, compare, and calc. the difference among the plans.
