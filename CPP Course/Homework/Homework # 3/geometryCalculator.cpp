/*
 Write a program that displays the following menu:

 Geometry Calculator

 Calculate the Area of a Circle
 Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
 Calculate the Area of a Triangle
 Quit
 Enter your choice (1-4):

 If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display its area. Use the following formula:

 area = πr2

 Use 3.14159 for π and the radius of the circle for r.

 If the user enters 2, the program should ask for the length and width of the rectangle and then display the rectangle’s area. Use the following formula:

 area = length * width

 If the user enters 3 the program should ask for the length of the triangle’s base and its height, and then display its area.  Use the following formula:

 area = base * height * 0.5

 If the user enters 4, the program should end.

 Input Validation:

 Display an error message if the user enters a number outside the range of 1 through 4 when selecting an item from the menu.
 Do not accept negative values for the dimensions.
