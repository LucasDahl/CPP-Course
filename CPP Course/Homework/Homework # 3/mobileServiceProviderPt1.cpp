 A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:

 Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.45 per minute.

 Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.40 per minute.

 Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.

 Write a program that first asks which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used. Then calculate the customer’s monthly bill and display the total amount due.

 Input Validation: Be sure the customer only selects packages A, B, or C.
