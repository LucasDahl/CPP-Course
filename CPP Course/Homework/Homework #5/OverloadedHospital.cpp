// MARK: - Task
/*
 Write a program that computes and displays the charges for a patient’s hospital stay. First, the program should ask if the patient was admitted as an in-patient or an out-patient.

 If the patient was an in-patient, the following data should be entered:

 The number of days spent in the hospital
 The daily rate
 Hospital medication charges
 Charges for hospital tests, etc.)
 The program should ask for the following data if the patient was an out-patient:
 charges for hospital services (lab tests, etc.)
 Hospital medication charges
 
 The program should use two overloaded functions called HospitalCharge to calculate the total charges. One of the functions should accept arguments for the in-patient data, while the other function accepts arguments for out-patient information. Both functions should return the total charges.

 Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for any data.
