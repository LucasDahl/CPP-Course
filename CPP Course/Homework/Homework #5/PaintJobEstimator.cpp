// MARK: - Task
/*
 A painting company has determined that for every 110 square feet of wall space, 1 gallon of paint and 8 hours of labor will be required. The company charges $25.00 per hour for labor.

 Write a modular program (a program that is divided into functions that perform each major task) that allows the user to enter

 the number of rooms that are to be painted and
 the price of the paint per gallon.
 It should also ask for the square feet of wall space in each room. (The wall space for a standard room is about 340 square feet.)
 It should then display the following data:

 The number of gallons of paint required
 The hours of labor required
 The cost of the paint
 The labor charges
 The total cost of the paint job.
 Input validation: Do not accept:

 A value less than 1 for the number of rooms
 A value less than $10.00 for the price of paint
 A negative value for square footage of wall space
