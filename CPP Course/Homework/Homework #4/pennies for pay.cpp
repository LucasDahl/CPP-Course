// MARK: - Task
/*
 Write a program that calculates how much a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny for the first day and two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day. The program asks the user for the number of days.

 Display a table showing how much the salary was for each day, and then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies.

 Input validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days worked.

// they made the day prior.
