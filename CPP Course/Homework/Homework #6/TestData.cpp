 Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array initialized with test data. Use any data type you wish. The program should have the following functions:

 (5 pt) getTotal. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the total of all the values in the array.
 (5 pt) getAverage. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the average of all the values in the array.
 (5 pt) getRowTotal. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the total of the values in the specific row.
 (5 pt) getColumnTotal. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a column in the array. The function should return the total of the values in the specific column.
 (5 pt) getHighestInRow. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the highest value in the specific row of the array.
 (5 pt) getLowestInRow. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the lowest value in the specific row of the array.
 Demonstrate each of the functions in this program.
